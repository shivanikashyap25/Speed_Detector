SPEED DETECTOR USING ARDUINO : The objective of this project was to create a cost-effective and reliable solution for measuring the speed of moving objects in various applications. The speed sensor consists of an Arduino UNO, a pair of IR sensors, toy car, jumper wires. The basic principle to find the speed of an moving object is by acquiring the distance and the time taken by the object to cover the distance and hence this project is aimed at finding out the time and the distance of the particular moving object and hence evaluate the speed at which the object is moving.
